# BEST-FIRST-SEARCH-AND-A-SEARCH

Comparison between Best First Search and A*

Best First Search (Greedy Search) uses only the heuristic function (e.g., Euclidean or Manhattan distance) to guide its search toward the goal. Since it does not consider the cost of the path traveled so far, it may take “shortcuts” that look promising but can lead to longer overall paths or dead ends. As a result, Best First Search is usually faster and explores fewer nodes, but it does not guarantee the shortest path.

A* Search, on the other hand, combines both the cost of the path so far (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate to the goal (h(n)), making its evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n). This ensures that if the heuristic is admissible, A* always returns the optimal shortest path. However, this comes at the cost of exploring more nodes and requiring more memory compared to Greedy Search. In practice, Best First Search is more efficient but less reliable, while A* is more robust and guarantees correctness.
